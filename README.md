# GNU/Linx infographics

These infographics are for new users who want to make the switch to GNU/Linux but are not entirely sure which distribution is the right for them.

Post about this: http://jancorazza.com/2013/06/gnulinux-infographics.

They contain a short description of the distributions and their respective pros and cons.

## How do I contribute?

You can contribute either by:

1. Committing a new thumbnail in `distro/`.
2. Editing the information in `distro/` and making it more precise, useful, articulated, etc.
3. Creating a new poster!

## Structure

 - `distro/` - information about different distributions and their thumbnails
 - `images/` - additional images used in posters
 - `links.md` - useful links that may be included in a poster
 - `posters-image` - finished images that you can use (see license section below)
 - `posters-source` - GIMP (`.xcf`) files that may be edited
