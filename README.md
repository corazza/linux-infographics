I’ve created two infographics with the intent of helping newbies with choosing the right GNU/Linux distro. The content is practically the same in both, but the second one has some graphical improvements that aren’t my own work.

This infographic is for new users who are wanting to make the switch to GNU/Linux but are not entirely sure what distribution is good for them.

It has a short description of the distribution and it's respective pros and cons.

## How do I contribute?

You can contribute either by:

1. Committing a new thumbnail in distro/
2. Editing the textual information in distros/ and making it more correct, precise, useful, articulated, etc
3. Creating a new poster! By using the information and art in distro/ and images/.

## Structure

Each featured distribution gets a directory in `distro/`. In its directory go the description, pros/cons, and its thumbnail. All other images are stored in `images/`. `Links.html` holds useful links that may be included in a poster. The root directory holds the posters and such.
