# GNU/Linx infographics

These infographics are for new users who want to make the switch to GNU/Linux but are not entirely sure which distribution is the right for them.

Post about this: http://jancorazza.com/2013/06/gnulinux-infographics.

They contain a short description of the distributions and their respective pros and cons.

## How do I contribute?

You can contribute either by:

1. Committing a new thumbnail in distro/
2. Editing the information in distros/ and making it more correct, precise, useful, articulated, etc
3. Creating a new poster! By using the information and art in distro/ and images/.

## Structure

Each featured distribution gets a directory in `distro/`. In its directory go the description, pros/cons, and its thumbnail. All other images are stored in `images/`. `Links.html` holds useful links that may be included in a poster. The root directory holds the posters and such.
